## Tools Used and Code Explanation

### Tools Used
The code provided is written in Python and utilizes the `requests` module, which allows for sending HTTP requests.

### Code Explanation
The code performs the following actions:

1. Imports the `requests` module for making HTTP requests.

2. Defines the login URL and payload:
   - `login_url`: The URL for the login endpoint of the SignalGas API.
   - `login_payload`: A dictionary containing the email and password for authentication.

3. Sends a POST request to the login URL with the login payload, attempting to authenticate the user.

4. Retrieves the response from the login request and converts it to JSON format using the `json()` method.

5. Checks if the login was successful:
   - If the response contains the message "Sign-in successful," it extracts the authentication token from the response.
   - If the login fails, it prints the error message.

6. If the login was successful, the code proceeds to perform additional actions:
   - Sends a GET request to the SignalGas API to retrieve product information.
   - Sets the `Authorization` header in the request with the retrieved authentication token.
   - Retrieves the response from the product request and converts it to JSON format.
   - Prints the product data.

7. If the login was successful, the code performs another action:
   - Sends a GET request to the SignalGas API to retrieve currency information.
   - Uses the same `Authorization` header as before.
   - Retrieves the response from the currency request and converts it to JSON format.
   - Prints the currency data.

8. The code includes a commented out section that suggests a signup call was removed from the code.
